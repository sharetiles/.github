# FAQ  
This FAQ covers common questions related to purchasing the Tiles Launcher Gen 1 License.  

## What's the data policy?  
We only store minimal metadata on our control plane. All other data is processed and stored on-device, at the edge, within the data plane perimetre, with TEE-enabled security.

## What platform do you use for payments?  
We use [Polar](https://polar.sh/) to manage billing and payments.  

## Why does the Launcher require Apple Silicon and macOS 26 or later?  
Unified memory is the only practical solution for continual learning on consumer devices, and it is widely available with Apple Silicon processors. The Launcher’s computer-use agents rely on the [Apple Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization) framework, which is only supported on macOS Tahoe 26 and later.  

## What is the Modelfile-based image flasher?  
It is built on [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/). The [Modelfile](https://ollama.readthedocs.io/en/modelfile/) (a Dockerfile-like format for models) makes it easier to run, build, and share fine-tuned models.  

## What updates are included with the license?  
You receive free updates for all pre-release and 1.x versions under the [once](https://once.com/) pricing model. TestFlight beta access is free but subject to availability and change.  

## Where can I get paid help and support?  
You’ll have access to a private paid channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SJWpz4Ugsm) community, with dedicated support included.
