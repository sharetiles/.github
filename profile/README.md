<p>Our vision is to make user-generated, malleable software a ubiquitous part of the future. 

To that end, we are working on <a href="https://tiles.run">Tiles Notebook</a>, a notebook interface that makes working with AI agents easier. It's a multiplayer, offline-first expereince based on MCP with support for generating widgets/artifacts. Our vision is to make personal software ubiquitous in the future.</p>
