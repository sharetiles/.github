  Tiles is the the best place to save and consume content. Private and collaborative. This is the SDK that powers it.

  Truly personal AI that respects privacy requires on-device learning from individual experience. Most existing systems either lack personalization or perform it only at build time. For real-time, adaptive systems, the primary bottleneck shifts from training to deployment.

With Tiles SDK, we’re building the on-device AI infrastructure to enable this: a system designed for continual learning using model chaining and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
