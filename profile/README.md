  <strong>We are Tiles HQ.</strong><br />
  Advancing on-device AI infrastructure for continual learning.
</p>

<p>
  Machines that learn from experience unlock truly useful Al. Most can't, because training stops at deployment. At Tiles, we're building the on-device AI infrastructure for continual learning using small language models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
