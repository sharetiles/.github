<p>Our vision is to make user-generated, malleable software a ubiquitous part of the future. 

To that end, we are working on <a href="https://tiles.run">Tiles Notebook</a>, a new interface for making personal software. Technically it's local-first, multiplayer enabled MCP client with notebook interface.</p> For inquiries about building personal software quickly and influencing the future of Tiles, reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@tiles.run">hello@tiles.run</a></p>
